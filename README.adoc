== Description

The `request validation` policy is used to validate the incoming HTTP request according to given rules.
A rule is defined for an input value. This input value supports EL expression and is validated against to constraint
rules.

Constraint rules can be:

* NOT_NULL: Input value is required
* MIN: Input value is a number and its value is greater or equals to a given parameter.
* MAX: Input value is a number and its value is lower or equals to a given parameter.
* MAIL: Input value is valid according to the mail pattern.
* PATTERN: Input value is valid according to the pattern given as a parameter.
* SIZE: Input value length is between two given parameters.

By default, if one of the rule can not be validated, the policy returns a `400` status code.
